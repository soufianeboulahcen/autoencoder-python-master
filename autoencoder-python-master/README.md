# Autoencoders - Fashion MNIST Dataset

**Autoencoders** are neural networks designed to learn representations of datasets (**encoding**) with the purpose of reconstructing them even if they contain noisy data (**decoding**). Autoencoders use unsupervised learning techniques to extract information from datasets and learn from them.

This repository contains a notebook built with **Google Colab** that shows how to use **Keras** to create an Autoencoder that processes the Fashion MNIST dataset. This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories along with a test set of 10,000 images.

Keras is an open-source deep-learning framework written in Python. We can use it to build and evaluate deep learning models.

You can open the `autoencoder_fashion_mnist.ipynb` notebook using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks to test it.
